## Problem Statement
Implement a ride share app which allows users to share rides with other users.
## Goal
To build a website that allows users to search for their ride partners. This is a convenient way for users to search other passengers going to the same destination and they can also look at the ratings of other users for safety and decide whether to travel with them or not,especially safe for women. This feature ensures safety and also makes way for convenient and happy rides at low cost.
## Features
1. They can create account and login.
2. The users can search for the available ride partners based on their source,destination,date and time.  
3. The users can send requests to other users who have the same pickup and destination points on the same day.
4) The users can accept invitations and chat with only the person whom they have scheduled ride with for further information.
5) The users can provide feedback and rating to their ride partners.

## Applications of our idea
This site can be used in our college itself. For example at the time of holidays, you can see in the oncampus group that many people are asking for someone to share cab and if they are available at that time or not. So this is where our site comes in handy. You just create an account and enter your pickup, destination, date and time it gives you the available users and u can directly chat with them. 
We can further extend the application to general public so that they get rides at low cost due to rising travelling expenses
## Further Improvements
The places where we can improve are:

1. We can use APIs for the pickup and destination points. We have tried to implement this but many websites were giving paid versions(including google).
2. In our chat box we can use sockets for real time chatting. Sockets are needed because if we implement sockets then there is no need to releod after every message. But in our case we need to reload to see the new message.
3. Add more designs to our UI and make it beautiful.
